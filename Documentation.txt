git status to check the status of the working repository
git ls-files to list all the files

to remove a file- rm filename  --> to remove file in staging not in directory
to remove a file- git rm filename --> to remove file in both staging and directory

To rename a file - git mv filename newfilename

To ignore files from git tracking add them in .gitignore file. We should create gitignore file in the root directory and then add the files there and add to staging and commit.

To remove a file only from staging area - git rm filename --cached
To get short status - git status -s
git diff --staged - To complare chnages between staging and committed >> Documentation.txt

git diff - To compare changes between working directory and staging area
